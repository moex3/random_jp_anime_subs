1
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:50,297
Eating outdoors

2
00:00:50,297 --> 00:00:52,995
is the essence of camping.

3
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:55,818
Even though this is just hot cocoa.

4
00:01:02,297 --> 00:01:03,312
It's lukewarm…

5
00:01:15,193 --> 00:01:19,094
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

6
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:38,405
EPISODE 2: PETIT CAMP AND YARD CAMP

7
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:42,609
This won't hold the heat that much longer.

8
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:49,400
Oh, this is…

9
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:54,198
the one Rin used.

10
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:58,708
It's pretty pricey.

11
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:03,697
3… 251 yen.

12
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:05,400
Hmm. Can't afford it.

13
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:08,395
Excuse me.

14
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:10,302
Yes, can I help you?

15
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,499
I'd like to heat up my drink.

16
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,604
Do you have any cheaper options?

17
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:17,604
Well, in that case…

18
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:20,505
How about this?

19
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:23,995
What's this?

20
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:37,899
A pocket stove.

21
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,302
It's so cute and compact.

22
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:43,812
Just put in the solid fuel
and light it up.

23
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,313
Perfect for a little camping
with hot cocoa.

24
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:06,417
It's hot!

25
00:04:09,302 --> 00:04:12,103
Nothing beats piping hot cocoa.

26
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,007
See you next time, Aya!

27
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:23,805
Bye.

28
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:25,808
Rin,

29
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:29,094
when the weather gets a bit warmer,

30
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:30,199
I'll come down to Yamanashi.

31
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:32,385
I'll drive a motorcycle,

32
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:34,002
just like you.

33
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:41,408
Motorcycle camping.

34
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:43,804
If it's going on the bike,

35
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:45,804
it has to be lightweight
and compact, right?

36
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:48,313
And easy to set up, too.

37
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:50,790
"TENTS FOR MOTORCYCLE CAMPING,"
Mountain climbing tents?

38
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,793
"MOUNTAINEERING TENTS"
Mountain climbing tents?

39
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:55,101
Stuff from the big brands sure is pricey.

40
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:57,210
Is there anything cheaper?

41
00:04:58,502 --> 00:04:59,547
"SUPER CHEAP MOUNTAIN CLIMBING"
980 yen?

42
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,383
"OUTDOOR DOME TENT"
980 yen?

43
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:01,695
What's with the crazy price gap?

44
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,309
Looks like it'll collapse
at the slightest breeze though.

45
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:07,705
Oh, right.

46
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:13,705
This one looks pretty decent.

47
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,611
We're here…

48
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,511
Welcome, girls!

49
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:25,408
Morning, Ena!

50
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,236
Morning.

51
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:29,007
Fresh out of the bed, huh?

52
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,381
A heartfelt reunion.

53
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:38,850
Chikuwa!

54
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:48,507
It must be cold outside, huh?

55
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:50,902
Sorry.

56
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:53,403
I'll get changed.
You girls go ahead and set up the tent.

57
00:05:53,793 --> 00:05:54,897
Okay!

58
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:59,384
The girls set to work immediately

59
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,705
and completed the task in no time.

60
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:03,007
All done!

61
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:06,304
Aoi, a new camping item?

62
00:06:07,398 --> 00:06:09,017
"PORTABLE COMPACT TABLE, 4000 YEN"
I placed an order.

63
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:10,513
"PORTABLE COMPACT TABLE, 4000 YEN"
right after we came back from Izu.

64
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:14,507
I've been looking for a colour
that matched my chair.

65
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:16,594
Nifty and spiffy.

66
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:18,803
The surface is fabric,

67
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:22,012
but it's got an aluminium board inside.
It looks pretty durable.

68
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,595
It sure does.

69
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:27,106
White gets dirty easily,

70
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,507
but I'll do my best
to use it with caution.

71
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:33,106
We are in your care.

72
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,117
Sorry to keep you guys waiting.

73
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:37,496
I'll set up Chikuwa's tent right away.

74
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:38,695
Wait.

75
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,507
Not yet.

76
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:45,497
Go ahead!

77
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:48,991
How cute!

78
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:49,885
DOG TENT 10,000 YEN

79
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:50,512
DOG COT 10,000 YEN

80
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:51,476
DOG SLEEPING BAG 15,000 YEN

81
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,787
CHIKUWA'S CAMPING SET
TOTAL: 35,000 YEN

82
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,710
Those are some dear prices!

83
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:58,705
Dog camping equipment isn't cheap.

84
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,713
But if the quality lives up to the price,

85
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,299
it should last longer.

86
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:04,907
That's true.

87
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:08,095
I've only used
my super-cheap tent a couple of times,

88
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,111
but the underside's already worn out.

89
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,100
Plus, one of the poles snapped

90
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,190
the first time we tried setting it up.

91
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:18,007
But thanks to that broken pole,

92
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:21,507
we became friends with Rin and Ena.

93
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:22,913
When you think about it like that,

94
00:07:22,914 --> 00:07:26,397
doesn't it feel like the tent
has already paid off big time?

95
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:28,902
Aoi, you said it perfectly!

96
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:30,596
That's so true!

97
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:32,298
Side note,

98
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:35,101
it wasn't easy to find a cot
that fit inside the tent.

99
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:37,096
I was finally able to get one
at a second-hand store.

100
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:39,506
Sure is a lot of work…

101
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:43,512
You are dearly loved, Chikuwa.

102
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,798
We're camping in Ena's yard! Woof!

103
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:54,897
Chikuwa in a tent, so cute.

104
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:57,602
Now, then…

105
00:07:58,112 --> 00:08:00,512
Time to give Aki a haircut.

106
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,397
I'm in your hands.

107
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:04,804
So, what kind of hairstyle
are we getting today?

108
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:09,293
Well, I was thinking about having the sides
and the back cut to about shoulder length.

109
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:14,012
Might as well make it shorter
and go for a "cool" look.

110
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:16,496
A cool girl, huh?

111
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,793
Cool? Something like this?

112
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:22,793
No, not that kind of cool!

113
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:27,012
I think a cute style
would suit Aki better!

114
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,791
Something fluffy and cute

115
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,804
would suit Aki perfectly.

116
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,402
Cute's not my thing.

117
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:36,606
Nah…

118
00:08:36,606 --> 00:08:37,798
How about this?

119
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,199
No, although it does look cute and fluffy…

120
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:42,595
In that case, let's do the right side cool

121
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:44,402
and the left side cute.

122
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:45,507
Please don't.

123
00:08:45,897 --> 00:08:50,405
Still, I think there's nothing more Aki
than the exposed forehead.

124
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:54,193
Original is the best, after all.

125
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:55,409
That's right.

126
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,606
I think the exposed forehead
suits Aki the best too.

127
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:01,891
Forget exposed forehead!

128
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:04,199
If you use that thing,
my scalp will be showing!

129
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:06,693
You two, hold her down for me.

130
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:08,798
Wait! Seriously?

131
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:12,704
No, don't!

132
00:09:13,902 --> 00:09:15,100
You're looking fresh.

133
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,406
I didn't plan on keeping my hair long,

134
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:20,908
but it feels like losing a piece of myself
with it cut short.

135
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:22,387
You'll get used to it

136
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:23,900
in no time.

137
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:26,126
I still think it has to be
the exposed forehead for Aki.

138
00:09:26,127 --> 00:09:27,192
You're still on that?

139
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:32,798
Now that Aki's haircut is done,

140
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,783
let's begin the barbecue.

141
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,194
I've been waiting to hear that!

142
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:38,861
"ALCOHOL FUEL"
What kind of sausages

143
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:40,204
"ALCOHOL FUEL"
did you bring, Nadeshiko?

144
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,304
"SUPER SPICY CHORIZO"
This kind.

145
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:43,892
"YAMANASHI PORK, HERB AND LEMON SAUSAGES"
I bought this.

146
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,897
"SUPER TASTY CHEESY FISH CAKES"
I brought this.

147
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:48,013
Does that count as a sausage?

148
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,882
"YUMMY CHICKEN BREAST SAUSAGE! YUM! WOOF!"
And Chikuwa's favourite.

149
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,007
You like that, Chikuwa?

150
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,002
What about you, Aki?

151
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,256
I brought this!

152
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:02,803
ON SALE, DOMESTIC GROUND PORK, 398 YEN

153
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:04,111
Ground pork?

154
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:08,501
Weren't you the one who said
to bring only sausages?

155
00:10:08,502 --> 00:10:10,709
Okay. Hold your horses…

156
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:12,080
"SAUSAGE CASING"
I'm going to use this

157
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:13,804
and this

158
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,523
to make my own sausages!

159
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:20,703
Make your own sausages?

160
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:21,986
SAUSAGE STUFFER, CASING

161
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:24,704
Homemade sausages? That sounds exciting!

162
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:26,903
When did you even get these?

163
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:30,087
My mum bought this years ago.

164
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,199
She never used it.
It's been left to collect dust.

165
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:33,600
Are you sure it's still good?

166
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:34,908
Wouldn't it have gone bad by now?

167
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:36,606
I'm not talking about the ground pork!

168
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,605
But are sausages really that easy to make?

169
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:43,106
The recipe doesn't seem too difficult.

170
00:10:43,397 --> 00:10:47,188
Just season the meat with spices and salt,

171
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,106
mix well and put it
in the sausage stuffer…

172
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,996
Aoi!

173
00:10:57,104 --> 00:10:58,788
You can't escape either.

174
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:06,012
You're next.

175
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:16,699
Impressive!

176
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:21,001
It's amazing how well-trained Chikuwa is.

177
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,001
That's not all my Chikuwa

178
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:25,497
can do.

179
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,699
Zombie dog?

180
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Aki…

181
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:46,706
Aki…

182
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,804
Let… Let me go!

183
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:54,490
Aki…

184
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:56,891
Ena's dad's been watching us all along!

185
00:11:58,304 --> 00:12:01,101
Stare…

186
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:05,214
SHIPPED, IN TRANSIT, OUT FOR DELIVERY

187
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:07,809
It's here.

188
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:12,304
My tent

189
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,714
has arrived.

190
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,606
That was easier than I expected.

191
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:42,298
IT'S BEEN A WHILE, RIN.

192
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:43,501
Who's this?

193
00:12:43,502 --> 00:12:45,007
SORRY, BUT WHO IS THIS?

194
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:45,616
OH, SORRY. IT'S AYANO.

195
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:47,401
WE MET AT NADESHIKO'S
GRANDMA'S HOUSE DURING THE NEW YEAR'S.

196
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:50,085
OH, IT'S YOU, AYA.
LONG TIME NO SEE. WHAT'S UP?

197
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:50,512
I BOUGHT A TENT AND SLEEPING BAG TOO.

198
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:52,513
THE WEATHER'S TURNED WARM, SO I FIGURED
I'D GO ON A CAMPING TRIP WITH MY MOTORCYCLE.

199
00:12:52,514 --> 00:12:53,329
WANT TO JOIN ME?

200
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:53,866
MOTORCYCLE CAMPING? SOUNDS NICE.

201
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:56,521
HAVE YOU DECIDED WHERE TO GO?

202
00:12:59,017 --> 00:12:59,906
120KM IS QUITE FAR.

203
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:00,454
SINCE IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME
TRAVELLING SO FAR,

204
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:01,000
I SUGGEST CHOOSING
SOMEWHERE CLOSER TO YOUR HOME.

205
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:02,000
BUT THAT'S A NORMAL TRIP FOR YOU, RIGHT?

206
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:02,959
BESIDES, I'LL BE DRIVING. IT'LL BE OKAY.

207
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,303
ARE YOU SURE?

208
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:06,834
THEN, WE'LL CHOOSE SOMEWHERE NEARBY.
I'LL GET IN TOUCH AGAIN CLOSER TO THE DATE.

209
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:09,803
GOT IT. I'LL BE WAITING.

210
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:10,903
Though…

211
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,604
LET'S CHOOSE A SPOT HALFWAY BETWEEN
WHERE WE LIVE!

212
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:13,007
ABOUT A 120KM DRIVE

213
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:15,517
Didn't expect Aya to be so laid-back.

214
00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:18,902
What about Nadeshiko?

215
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,309
Welcome.

216
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:28,803
Let's get back on track
and begin the sausage making.

217
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,156
First, add spices and salt
to the ground meat,

218
00:13:32,157 --> 00:13:34,513
mix, and knead until it becomes sticky.

219
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:38,699
Then, add okra, natto,
and Egyptian spinach

220
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,304
to make the meat filling stickier.

221
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:42,412
Don't add random stuff!

222
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:45,210
Then, cut the casing
to the required length

223
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,902
and slide it onto the metal tube
of the sausage stuffer,

224
00:13:48,903 --> 00:13:50,507
tying the front end.

225
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,501
It looks like shedded snake skin…

226
00:13:52,502 --> 00:13:54,502
Hey, stop right there.

227
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,408
Next, stuff the prepared meat filling
into the sausage stuffer.

228
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:00,292
To prevent air from entering the sausages,

229
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:02,095
fill the casing
with just the right amount of filling.

230
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,610
100% PORK SAUSAGE (UNCOOKED)

231
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,901
Once the meat filling is stuffed,
tie the back end of the casing.

232
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:10,099
Then, divide it into sections
according to preference, and it's done.

233
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,907
How's that?

234
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:14,116
It looks great.

235
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:16,209
That was easy!

236
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,106
Right?

237
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,595
Let's fry them up, Aki.

238
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:27,266
Oh, right. Got to set this up first.

239
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:29,512
Huh? Isn't that…

240
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:34,293
It's the kitchen rack you used
as a mini table at the Christmas camp.

241
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:37,204
Can't put the frying pan directly
on top of the alcohol stove.

242
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:41,011
You really know how to make the most
out of that kitchen rack.

243
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:44,298
Well, let's get started.

244
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:50,595
As expected, not quite enough fire.

245
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,095
Let's dump the meat in.

246
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,506
That's too many…

247
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,603
It's sizzling!

248
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:04,903
Even though we're just
frying some sausages

249
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,006
with the skillets, this is pretty nice.

250
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:09,298
Uh-huh.

251
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,011
I've washed and seasoned them
with olive oil.

252
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,996
Stuff don't stick or burn easily anymore.

253
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,402
They're great to use.

254
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:20,209
You're a "well-seasoned" chef
with how much care you put into your wares.

255
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,604
Aki, I think they're done.

256
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:23,907
Oh, you're right.

257
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:27,405
Aki, can I try one now?

258
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,715
Get them while they're hot!

259
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,902
Time to dig in!

260
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,605
The herb sausage is done.

261
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:42,204
The chorizo needs a little more time.

262
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,762
At least say something about it!
You guys are scaring me…

263
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:47,896
Um, well…

264
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:49,897
You should try one too.

265
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:01,792
The chorizo has a nice spicy kick to it!

266
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:03,704
She's using the chorizo
as a palate cleanser!

267
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,199
I mean, it's not that bad…

268
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,006
Could use a little more fat…

269
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:12,610
Tastes rustic.

270
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:14,913
Don't bother sugarcoating anything.
It's disgusting.

271
00:16:15,402 --> 00:16:17,402
Exactly, Aki.

272
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,621
Why?

273
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:23,900
It was such a simple recipe!
Where did I go wrong?

274
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:25,897
Aki, look at this.

275
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:27,105
Take note!

276
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:30,792
The ground meat must be kept
in the freezer before use.

277
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:34,308
The same goes for the sausage stuffer
and the mixing bowl.

278
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:36,098
When preparing the meat mixture,

279
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,501
to prevent the ground meat from being
affected by the temperature of the hand,

280
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:42,906
please add crushed ice to the processor

281
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:44,595
to keep the temperature low.

282
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,704
It says that if the temperature
of the meat is too high,

283
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:48,901
the lean and fatty parts won't mix well,

284
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:50,714
and the stuffing will dry out.

285
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:53,668
So, that's why…

286
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:54,906
The steps are simple,

287
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:57,006
but it's strict on temperature control.

288
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:59,196
I don't want to waste all that meat.

289
00:16:59,204 --> 00:17:02,699
I'll bring it home
and make some minced meat out of it.

290
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,803
Don't beat yourself up over it, Aki.

291
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,001
Are you comforting me, Chikuwa?

292
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:16,704
Eh?

293
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:24,808
"LEASH"
Oh, you just wanted to go on a walk.

294
00:17:26,008 --> 00:17:28,111
Let's go on a walk, then.

295
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,584
Bring the chairs too.

296
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:30,403
Chairs?

297
00:17:53,496 --> 00:17:55,210
This place is swell.

298
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,199
Makes me wish we had some manjus.

299
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:07,397
Our DIY alcohol stoves
came in handier than I expected.

300
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:11,157
Yeah, using the stuff you made
by yourself is pretty nice.

301
00:18:12,117 --> 00:18:16,120
Aki, any other things we can DIY?

302
00:18:17,908 --> 00:18:20,093
How about we make some leather crafts?

303
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:23,199
We can use them as covers
for the cooking gas cans and bags.

304
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,604
Good idea. Sounds stylish.

305
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,194
And

306
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:29,704
we can carve chopsticks and spoons
out of wood.

307
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,391
Great idea!

308
00:18:31,392 --> 00:18:33,699
That could come in handy in a situation…

309
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:35,782
I forgot the chopsticks.

310
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:36,798
Leave it to me!

311
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:39,594
There we go, Rin!

312
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:40,407
Amazing.

313
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:42,115
It'd be so cool if we could do that.

314
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:48,907
You smell so nice, Chikuwa.

315
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:54,402
It's cherry blossom season soon.

316
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:55,912
Should we go flower viewing together?

317
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:57,808
That sounds nice.

318
00:18:57,808 --> 00:18:59,095
I'm in!

319
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,610
An outdoor activities club
flower viewing camp!

320
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:04,506
A flower viewing camp sounds neat.

321
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:08,194
Are there any campsites around here
suitable for flower viewing?

322
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:12,208
There are cherry blossoms
around Lake Shibire and Lake Tanuki.

323
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:14,402
But it won't be a pleasant camping trip

324
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:15,779
if everyone else had the same idea

325
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,017
and we all end up

326
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:19,292
at an overcrowded lake.

327
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:20,694
True.

328
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:25,209
Find a hidden gem where we can enjoy
the cherry blossoms in peace

329
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,406
or just go flower viewing,

330
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:28,897
we'll have to choose.

331
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:34,100
What do you think, Chikuwa?

332
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:43,308
Take care on your way back, everybody.

333
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:44,996
Bye.

334
00:19:45,997 --> 00:19:47,605
See you again soon, Chikuwa.

335
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:49,912
"HEATED FLOORING"
The house has heated flooring.

336
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:52,297
Chikuwa's already asleep.

337
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:54,121
He's been completely domesticated.

338
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,610
Bye!

339
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:01,897
The days are getting longer.

340
00:20:02,508 --> 00:20:04,703
It's almost spring.

341
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,912
Yeah.

342
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:10,408
Bye, you two.

343
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:12,308
See you.

344
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,698
SOLO, BOUND FOR KOFU

345
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:26,387
I went to Izu with everyone

346
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:27,694
and had my first yard camp today.

347
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:30,799
Maybe I should go solo camping again?

348
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:38,621
It's time for a solo camp.

349
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:43,913
It's Aya.

350
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:45,906
NADESHIKO, YOU, ME, AND RIN!
LET'S GO CAMPING TOGETHER!

351
00:20:45,907 --> 00:20:47,292
IN OIGAWA!

352
00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:49,206
Oigawa?

353
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,012
Good work today.

354
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:56,298
I'm down for the Oigawa camp!

355
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:57,906
Okay.

356
00:20:57,907 --> 00:20:59,010
Great.

357
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:01,204
But why Oigawa?

358
00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:03,605
It'd be difficult if we chose a location

359
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:05,011
that wasn't somewhere midpoint.

360
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,389
So, I did some research

361
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,298
and found out that Oikawa
happened to be somewhere in between.

362
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:13,187
We're planning
to drive around Oigawa first

363
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,095
before heading to the campsite.

364
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:17,696
You'll be on your own
until then, is that okay?

365
00:21:17,704 --> 00:21:19,105
No problem…

366
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:24,101
I was just thinking about
going on a solo camp.

367
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,908
I'll enjoy it as a solo camp.

368
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,918
So, solo camp.

369
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:32,204
So, solo camp solo.

370
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,402
And I'll be bringing that hamburg steak.

371
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:38,793
Look forward to it.

372
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,283
Really? Yay!

373
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:43,209
Hamburg steak?

374
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:51,313
I'm back.

375
00:23:26,699 --> 00:23:35,601
NEXT EPISODE: BRIDGE COUNTRY

376
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:36,206
WHEN ENJOYING CAMPING,
BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE RULES

377
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:36,810
OF THE CAMPGROUND AND ITS FACILITIES.

378
00:23:36,811 --> 00:23:38,003
DON'T FORGET TO PUT OUT YOUR CAMPFIRE
AND DISPOSE OF YOUR GARBAGE.

379
00:23:38,004 --> 00:23:39,209
TEMPERATURES CAN CHANGE QUICKLY,
SO CHECK THE WEATHER FORECAST BEFOREHAND.

380
00:23:39,216 --> 00:23:40,216
WEAR WARM CLOTHING IF NECESSARY
TO PREVENT COLD.
