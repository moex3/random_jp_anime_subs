[theme music playing]

2
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,816
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

3
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,513
We're finally back!

4
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,430
[yawns]

5
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,266
The air up here is so much better
than the dungeons'.

6
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,435
[Mickbell] Is this sunrise or sunset?

7
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,895
-[Maizuru] Do not touch the window!
-[both gasp]

8
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,022
The spell is still in effect here!

9
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,398
-Kabru.
-Hm?

10
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,692
I'm reporting to the Island Lord tomorrow.

11
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,403
I'd like you to join me as a witness.

12
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,198
Do you plan on telling him
about everything?

13
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,409
[Shuro] I don't think it's necessary
to mention Laios and his party.

14
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,289
Mostly I just don't want Falin
to murder anyone else.

15
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,666
That makes sense.

16
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,960
Why don't you use the rest of the day
to get some sleep?

17
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,795
[Mickbell] Whoa! See that, Kuro?

18
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,171
[Kuro] Big ship. It's huge.

19
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,673
-[gasps]
-[Mickbell] I wonder if the people on it

20
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,007
have lots of money!

21
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,050
-[hurried footsteps]
-[both] Hm?

22
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,176
[gasps]

23
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,929
[melancholy music playing]

24
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,305
[Kabru] This isn't good.

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,393
Toshiro, we need to see
the Island Lord right away.

26
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,687
Is that ship special?

27
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,064
It belongs to the Elves of the West.

28
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,316
[Kabru] That bird figurehead.

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,735
Must be the Canaries then.

30
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,574
[Kabru]
a certain level of danger.</i></c.bg_transparent>

31
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,284
When that happens,

32
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,704
their mission is to investigate
the dungeon and conquer it.

33
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:46,249
I've heard rumors that they've been
putting pressure on the Island Lord,

34
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,293
but it looks like they're switching
to coercion.

35
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,837
How is something like that allowed?

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,006
Isn't this a tall-men region?

37
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,135
To the elves and dwarves,
races with short lives are like infants.

38
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,097
And sadly, the Island Lord's
not very good at negotiating.

39
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,390
[Kabru]

40
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,352
Hm?

41
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,104
[Namari] Hey!

42
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,772
If it isn't Shuro!

43
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,065
[Shuro] Hello, Namari.

44
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,817
[sighs] Where is Falin?

45
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,652
[sad groan]

46
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,612
Hmm.

47
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,573
Laios and the others
haven't given up yet, though.

48
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,241
Is that so?

49
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,288
-Are they still eating monsters?
-Yes, they are.

50
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,499
Excuse me,
but we're here to see the Island Lord.

51
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,752
Oh, you're out of luck then.

52
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,755
[Namari] Some important people
suddenly came to talk with him.

53
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,257
And they've been in there for hours now.

54
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,175
[gasps]

55
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,259
So we're too late.

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,053
We have to go inside.

57
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,262
Is that really wise?

58
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,390
[Kabru] If the elves take control
of the dungeon, it's over.

59
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,686
The town I'm from also prospered
from a dungeon.

60
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,024
[Kabru]
monsters flooded the town,</i></c.bg_transparent>

61
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,943
the elves came, and many died.

62
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,947
Why was my family
part of the ones who were killed?

63
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,326
My mother was a single parent,
did everything she could to raise me.

64
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,037
She didn't deserve to die like that.

65
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,707
[Kabru] I've vowed to never let
that happen again.

66
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,586
The system in which a single race
holds all the power,

67
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,380
it isn't healthy for anyone.

68
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,215
[soft groan]

69
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,179
Forgive me, but…

70
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,182
I've come here to deliver a report
to the Island Lord.

71
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,850
[both groan]

72
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,477
Excuse me.

73
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,313
As you can see,
we're in the middle of something.

74
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,648
[Cithis] Come back later.

75
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,484
It's a report about the situation
in the dungeon.

76
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,027
[Kabru] Please hear me out.

77
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,613
-Seriously?
-It must be important.

78
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,282
[Kabru]

79
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,034
Make it brief.

80
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,912
Not too long ago, during our exploration,

81
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,416
we encountered a human
who turned into a monster.

82
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,167
-What?
-[gasps]

83
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,794
Damn it. A Chimera.

84
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,921
[Cithis] It's progressing faster
than expected.

85
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,756
See? I told you all!

86
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,592
We didn't have time to twiddle our thumbs
and wait for an answer!

87
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,261
Let's give the order to make landfall!

88
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,470
We won't allow that!

89
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,848
[Cithis]
The elderly need not get worked up.

90
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,727
Country borders are so trivial
compared to the lives of people.

91
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,147
Just who do you think you are?
Treating me like I'm old and senile!

92
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,733
Tansu, please, I think we've said enough.

93
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,817
What?

94
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,527
You're a true Island Lord.

95
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,237
Understanding and wise.

96
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,239
[Lycion] Now,
if you would please stamp here.

97
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,450
[Mr. Tansu] Don't do it!
You can't give in!

98
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,578
Did we actually end up
making things worse here?

99
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,246
[Kabru]

100
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,541
if I had enough strength
to conquer a dungeon,

101
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,126
there wouldn't be a problem.

102
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,794
But I don't.

103
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,881
So I started looking around
for adventurers

104
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,924
who were more skilled that I could assist.

105
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,096
However, most of the people I found
were self-serving and worthless.

106
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,851
By the time I accepted my fate
and tried to conquer the dungeon myself,

107
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,729
I heard rumors about the Touden siblings.

108
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,440
I have a feeling
that they were brought up pretty well.

109
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,109
They have good instincts,
but no real ambition.

110
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,487
[gold stripper]
They're honestly kinda weird.

111
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,573
[Kabru]
the stranger they seemed.</i></c.bg_transparent>

112
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,658
Despite not being that strong,

113
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,036
they reached the deeper floors
of the dungeon.

114
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,914
They would give money
to people with poor reputations.

115
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,416
And their origins
and the strange company they kept

116
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,751
were hard to follow.

117
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,504
Still, there's something about the brother

118
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:23,257
that made me feel he was deeply connected
to the destiny of this island.

119
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,634
-[Kabru] Hey.
-

120
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,594
-[Laios] I'm sorry. I'm in a rush.
-

121
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,553
[Kabru] May I sit next to you?

122
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,846
-
-[Laios] Thanks for the meal.

123
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,723
-
-[Kabru] You dropped something!

124
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,267
And once I did, I finally understood.

125
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,352
[magical chiming]

126
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,604
He only thinks about monsters.

127
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,483
Therefore, we can't trust him
to consider the future of the island.

128
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,985
But there's one thing I can say for sure.

129
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,613
At this moment, among the tall-men,

130
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,491
he's the one who's closest
to the heart of the dungeon.

131
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,953
This will more than likely be the first
and last chance we get.

132
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,747
So I can't let the elves get in his way.

133
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll figure out what to do
about him after.

134
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,836
-Enough already.
-Huh?

135
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,379
You can do whatever you want.

136
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,380
-[happy gasp]
-[Mr. Tansu] My lord!

137
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,965
-I'll let them know to make landfall.
-[angry groan]

138
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,758
-[Kabru] Please wait!
-Hm?

139
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,218
It's too dangerous.

140
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,680
The types of monsters, architecture,
and environments,

141
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,140
all of it is in turmoil.

142
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,183
We're already aware of this.

143
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,811
It's a characteristic of dungeons
showing growth.

144
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,896
We have to stop it as soon as possible.

145
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,399
In human terms, a growth spurt.

146
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,901
This is when it requires
the most nutrients.

147
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,403
What's all this now?

148
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,780
[Kabru] About 15 years ago,

149
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,199
a dungeon destroyed my hometown.

150
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,785
It was a town called Utaya.

151
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,370
Fifteen years ago?

152
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,413
Then, wouldn't that mean…

153
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,541
No way! Are you the child
they say survived that incident?

154
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,835
I did hear that the vice-captain
or someone

155
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,462
had brought a young one home with them.

156
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,379
[Kabru] Yes.

157
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,465
They took care of me for several years.

158
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,382
Oh?

159
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,926
You were probably spoiled,
but became an adventurer?

160
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,555
It was my dream to join a squad,
but I couldn't as a tall-man.

161
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:57,351
I didn't wanna repeat that tragedy,
so I wanted a way to help.

162
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,603
[Cithis] How admirable.

163
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,188
[Fleki] Are you getting enough to eat?

164
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,857
You should go and visit
the vice-captain sometime.

165
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,192
[Mithrun] Anyway…

166
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,193
[gasps]

167
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,945
You mentioned "nutrients".

168
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,197
Tell me more.

169
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,200
Well, because of your efforts,

170
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,952
Utaya's dungeon was
quickly destroyed. However…

171
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,206
there were many casualties
among the soldiers and civilians.

172
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,584
It was due to the dead
turning into monsters

173
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,835
and eating the living.

174
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:27,215
Soldiers were ambushed
before they could do anything.

175
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,593
Rely on numbers,
and Utaya will repeat itself.

176
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,221
I suggest we seal the dungeon instead.

177
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,349
We can't do anything
that will end up feeding it.

178
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,685
I'm pretty sure it's not your intention
to cause damage to the dungeon

179
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,479
during combat anyway.

180
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,105
How many people are inside?

181
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,525
[Kabru] The majority of them
are on the first floor.

182
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,777
Let's evacuate them slowly.

183
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,696
All humans have some sort of connection.

184
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,116
And I know some people
who can definitely help out.

185
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,826
So just leave it to me!

186
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,121
[surprised gasp]

187
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,873
[Shuro]

188
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,502
he still ate monsters
despite everything he went through?

189
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,631
[Mithrun] Begin preparations…

190
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,632
[shocked gasp]

191
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,509
-…for the investigation.
-Huh?

192
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,137
I suspect you're plotting something.

193
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,516
[Mithrun] If that's the case,
show me what you've got.

194
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,352
Should anything go wrong,
my troops will rush in.

195
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,270
[both groan]

196
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,396
Understood?

197
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,897
Yes.

198
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,529
[yawns]

199
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,114
[Izutsumi groans]

200
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,491
[Senshi] So are they like scrambled eggs?

201
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,492
Huh?

202
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,870
[Senshi] You said before
that people compare souls to eggs.

203
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,123
But if you're referring to souls
that are mixed together,

204
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,626
then what would that mean
in relation to how eggs are cooked?

205
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,754
For example, scrambled eggs,
a sunny-side-up egg,

206
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,632
and a poached egg
would all have different stories.

207
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,800
Listen, Senshi.

208
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,428
I didn't make that comparison
for you to take what I said

209
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,138
and try to make a joke out of it.

210
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,639
[Senshi] Who's making jokes?

211
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:02,518
I was actually impressed
by how interesting a comparison it was.

212
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,606
There's nothing else that behaves
in as many different ways as an egg does.

213
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,150
For example, eggs get firm when heated,

214
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,028
but the white and yolk solidify
at different temperatures.

215
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,989
Frothiness, moisture attention, viscosity.

216
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,868
And the most interesting one,
emulsification.

217
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,871
Even things that don't mix naturally
like oil and water,

218
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,290
mix beautifully
under the right conditions.

219
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,458
Just like this.

220
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,084
Well, that's…

221
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,754
Wait, souls are actually
nothing like eggs!

222
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,255
-[sighs]
-Laios, you mind handing me

223
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,214
that bread there?

224
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,968
-[grunts]
-[groans] Hm?

225
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,560
[Senshi] It's ready!

226
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,271
SOUL EGGS BENEDICT

227
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,775
So, how are we supposed to eat this?

228
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,277
[Senshi] Pick up the bread
with your knife and fork.

229
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,322
Then use the bread to scoop
the yolk and sauce as you eat.

230
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,038
[Laios] Delicious as usual.

231
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,165
-[Izutsumi groans]
-Hm?

232
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,541
If you don't mind,

233
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,544
could you stop looking around
at stuff that isn't really there?

234
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,254
Or is there something?

235
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,297
I don't think so.

236
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,050
[Izutsumi] I just thought
I felt some kind of presence.

237
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,009
Huh?

238
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:17,927
[terrified gasp]

239
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,679
Does that mean this isn't a hallucination?

240
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,598
Huh?

241
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,933
[creepy music playing]

242
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,685
Well, when I got mana sickness,

243
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,480
remember when I mentioned
I was seeing and hearing things?

244
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,315
That never went away.

245
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,609
Seriously? Why didn't you say something?

246
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,445
Because Chil would just yell at me
and tell me I'm sick in the head.

247
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,863
That's because you are.

248
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,989
[dejected sigh]

249
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,699
[Senshi] What are you hallucinating?

250
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,327
Hm? [groans]

251
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,705
Day in and day out,
something keeps trying to talk to me.

252
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,208
[Laios]
I couldn't tell what it was saying.</i></c.bg_transparent>

253
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,087
But gradually, its voice and shape
started getting clearer.

254
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,465
It's pretty scary,
so I've been pretending not to see it.

255
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,885
Then you could actually
hear me speaking after all.

256
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:00,845
[groans]

257
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,763
[Marcille] So what did it say?

258
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,599
[Laios] Well, it's not too happy
that I was ignoring it.

259
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,726
I wonder if talking to it is okay.

260
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,270
[Marcille] Do you think it's evil?

261
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,729
[Laios] Uh, not sure.

262
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,731
-Possibly?
-[ghost 1 grunts]

263
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,275
Hello there.

264
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,943
[Laios] Can I help you with something?

265
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,278
-[indistinct chatter]
-Uh-huh.

266
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,279
[Laios] Hmm.

267
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,697
What's it saying now?

268
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,117
[Laios] It's mad at me because I thought
it was an evil ghost.

269
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,034
[both groan]

270
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,161
-Also…
-[all] Hm?

271
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,415
…it's asking if we've forgotten
that it saved us from the, uh, mage.

272
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,541
Huh?

273
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,377
[Marcille]

274
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,005
Right. How can I forget that whole thing?

275
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,506
[Senshi] Please give it our thanks.

276
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,008
Hm. Mm-hm.

277
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,510
I guess it wants
to introduce us to someone.

278
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,887
[Laios] Thoughts?

279
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,722
It's not the god of death, is it?

280
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,849
Well, we don't have many options, so…

281
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,766
All right!

282
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,144
[Laios] We're ready to go
whenever you are!

283
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,271
[eerie music playing]

Huh? [soft gasp]

Wait. What the heck?

300
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,311
Where are we?

301
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,104
-[villager 1] Hey!
-Huh?

302
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,106
Out of the road, please!

303
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,692
Is… that a Unicorn?

304
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,779
That clothing…

305
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,489
Did you guys come from the outside?

306
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,367
No, we came from the dungeon and--

307
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,826
[villager 1] I can't believe it!

308
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,953
Uh, come with me!

309
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:55,125
[tranquil music playing]

310
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,129
[Laios] I have never seen monsters
be this docile before.

311
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,006
It's 'cause they're ordered
not to hurt us,

312
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,425
-so we can coexist here.
-Oh.

313
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,761
That's not gonna be the case
for outsiders though.

314
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,889
[villager 1] So make sure you hold on
to the stuff I gave you.

315
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:09,807
-[Izutsumi groans]
-Hm?

316
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,767
Izutsumi, something wrong?

317
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,269
Teleportation sickness?

318
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,020
She's probably tired.

319
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,482
[Laios] Is that the Golden Castle?

320
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,400
[villager 1] Sure is.

321
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,319
And the ghosts that brought us
to this place,

322
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,405
are they actual residents too?

323
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,531
Pretty much.

324
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,868
Well, the person you're about to meet
has more info.

325
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,036
Maybe they'll know why you were chosen.

326
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,621
[villager 1] 'Cause we sure don't.

327
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,290
We were "chosen"?

328
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,667
[villager 1 sighs]
This is it.

329
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,793
Just sit tight, okay?

330
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,299
If you're looking for the master,
he went to the church.

331
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,426
[villager 1 panting]

332
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,678
-It's them.
-Huh?

333
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,971
[villager 2] Those guys?

334
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,433
[villager 1] Guess we came here
at a pretty bad time.

335
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,643
-[soft groan]
-Until the master comes back here,

336
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,937
why don't you try to relax in the village?

337
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,939
[villager 1] Seems like everyone
really wants

338
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,691
to show you their hospitality.

339
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,360
What should we take them around
to see first?

340
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,195
The village isn't that special so…

341
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,781
They're all residents
of the Golden Castle?

342
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,617
[Senshi] Yeah,
but I don't see any old folk.

343
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,912
Honestly, I'd like to see
where the monsters are being raised!

344
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,829
[both] Huh?

345
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,207
[Senshi] I wanna take a tour
of the fields we saw on the way over.

346
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,627
Huh? That's what you're interested in?

347
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,837
I mean, that's easy enough.

348
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,839
-[all] Hurray!
-[laughter]

349
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,342
[Marcille] I'll just wait for them
to get back.

350
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,053
Can't leave Izutsumi alone anyway.

351
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,095
I agree.

352
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,139
[Laios] Th--That's a Minotaur!

353
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,849
And it's female!

354
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,225
[awed gasp]

355
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,727
We milk this instead of cows.

356
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,646
Why are you raising monsters?

357
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,563
Oh.

358
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,107
Because normal livestock
was hard to get a hold of.

359
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,567
Whoa.

360
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,738
[awed gasp]

361
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,784
[Senshi] Wow.

362
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,327
What a beautiful field.

363
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,245
It's so well-tended too.

364
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,332
Is everything here used up
by the villagers?

365
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,834
We admittedly waste quite a lot of it.

366
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,878
But if we didn't have fields
to keep us busy,

367
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,254
we'd have nothing to do.

368
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,549
[villager 3] It's mostly in appearance,
but we try to mimic surface life.

369
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,717
Really?

370
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,761
[worried groan]

371
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,138
Izutsumi, are you okay?

372
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,891
[breathes softly]

373
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,394
[Marcille]
she doesn't seem sick, I guess.</i></c.bg_transparent>

374
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,645
[Marcille groans]

375
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,272
-Sorry. We don't mean to interrupt but…
-Huh?

376
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,941
-[quirky music playing]
-Hm.

377
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,401
Dresses?

378
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,485
Exactly!

379
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,237
They're dresses we made by hand.

380
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,656
We've got so bored
of modeling them ourselves,

381
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,658
we need the fresh face
of an outsider to do it.

382
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,660
Sure if you want me to.

383
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,911
[villagers squealing happily]

384
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,287
Which should we try?

385
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,164
It has to be the red one.

386
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,290
You'll have to forgive us.

387
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,836
Our dresses might seem a little
old-fashioned from your perspective.

388
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,295
I'm sure it's fine.

389
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,298
[ethereal music playing]

390
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,216
[all exclaim]

391
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,803
[Marcille]
than what I expected.</i></c.bg_transparent>

392
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,138
Guess this is what happens

393
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,682
when you've been isolated
for a thousand years.

394
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,058
[villager 4] Try this on next!

395
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,060
[Chilchuck gulping]

396
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,437
[loud exhale]

397
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,563
This is great!

398
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,442
I'm pretty picky about my alcohol,
but this isn't bad at all.

399
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,776
Happy to hear.

400
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,987
I've been serving it to my orc customers,

401
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,448
and this recent batch
is really popular among them.

402
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,284
Yeah, I bet.

403
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,703
Oh, what about wine? Do you make that?

404
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,622
Well, I do, but it's much newer
than making ale.

405
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,418
Been doing that 400 years now,
so making the switch has been tricky.

406
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,919
[Chilchuck] That long, huh?

407
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,671
Sounds pretty established.

408
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,131
What generation are you?

409
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,342
I started it when I was 600,
so first generation.

410
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,220
-[Chilchuck] Come again? Hm?
-[hurried footsteps]

411
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,555
Chilchuck. Guess what?

412
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,098
They let me milk a Minotaur!

413
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,600
-[Laios panting]
-[Chilchuck] Hey, good for you.

414
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,060
Keep that to yourself next time.

415
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,978
-[Senshi] This place is incredible!
-[both] Huh?

416
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,522
They completely succeeded
in cultivating monsters

417
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,732
and made it an art!

418
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,858
Do you see that?

419
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,527
[Senshi] It's the biggest Dryad garden
I've ever seen!

420
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,654
The Minotaur had four nipples like a cow!

421
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,657
-[garbled chatter]
-I'm not feeling so good.

422
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,744
That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

423
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,412
You really missed out.

424
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,915
By the way, where did the other two go?

425
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,958
What's with the weird non sequitur?

426
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,127
-[Marcille] Uh, we're over here.
-[heels thudding]

427
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,338
[playful music playing]

428
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,631
[soft groan]

429
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,259
[Chilchuck] What in the hell are
you wearing? Playing dress up, huh?

430
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,761
D-Don't misunderstand!

431
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,763
I was asked to wear this, I swear.

432
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,181
Actually…

433
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,475
This was the tamest one I tried on.

434
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,392
NOT TAME

435
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,645
Marcille, you, uh…

436
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,106
Uh, yeah, Laios?

437
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,652
[Laios] You have any clue
why she's stuck to you like that?

438
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,153
Oh, that-- that? Right, yeah!

439
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,030
I have no idea. That's so weird!

440
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:39,159
[sighs] It's like she's switched brains
with a child or something.

441
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,119
-[groans]
-[grunts]

442
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,453
Oh!

443
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,454
-No!
-Huh?

444
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,165
[Marcille] Lots of barriers
have been cast here

445
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,667
in many different layers.

446
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,170
And it seems like
it's affecting Izutsumi in some way.

447
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,506
It's because she's half-monster, right?

448
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,423
[Marcille] Yeah.

449
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,761
But I've never seen a barrier
make monsters not aggressive before.

450
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,181
[Marcille]
I really wish I could decipher this.

451
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,935
But I don't know most of these characters
and I don't have time to learn!

452
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:08,814
Why the hell do these things have to be
so hard to read and secretive?

453
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,192
Anyway, this really is an amazing place.

454
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,570
[Marcille] Under different circumstances,

455
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,947
I wouldn't mind staying here forever.

456
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,408
Same here.

457
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,871
[Chilchuck groans]

458
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,330
-[door creaks open]
-[both] Hm?

459
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,332
[villager 5]
My apologies for the long wait.

460
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,292
It isn't much,

461
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,711
but we've prepared a warm meal
for all of you.

462
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,920
This way, please.

463
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,465
-[door creaks open]
-Huh?

464
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,010
[man] Uh, welcome, everyone.

465
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,720
I've been wanting to meet you.

466
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,763
I'm Yaad. It's a pleasure.

467
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,473
You already know of Delgal, yes?

468
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,559
[Yaad] Well, he's my grandfather.

469
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,727
Delgal…

470
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,854
[Yaad] Please, feel free to take a seat.

471
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,440
You're wondering why I've called you here.

472
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,483
This will take some time to explain.

473
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,360
Let's eat first.

474
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,656
VEGETABLES IN SLIME ASPIC
BEEF RIB STEAK

475
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,617
BLADE FISH LOAF
POTATO AND RABBIT SOUP

476
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,869
Uh, is this meat?

477
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,039
Yes! As your party
had specifically requested,

478
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,749
we prepared Minotaur meat.

479
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,876
[both groan]

480
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,213
Does everyone in the village
routinely eat monsters too?

481
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,505
There are some who do,

482
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,008
although we don't really need
to consume food.

483
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,259
[both] Huh?

484
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,762
[Yaad] Our sense of taste
has completely dulled.

485
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,265
Aside from that,
we have no real appetite to speak of.

486
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,018
Such is the curse of immortality

487
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:31,146
that the mad mage cast
on the people of this village.

488
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,189
[Senshi] Hmm.

489
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,026
Do you know why the mage
would do something like that?

490
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,236
No.

491
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,696
When I grew old enough
to know what was happening,

492
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,240
the mage was already in a state

493
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,659
where communicating with him
was difficult.

494
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,454
But please, don't let
our problems stop you.

495
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,623
Go eat up to your heart's content.

496
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,958
We may not get hungry,

497
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,544
but simply being able to watch others eat
still brings us joy.

498
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,505
[Marcille and Chilchuck]
Well, now I definitely can't say

499
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,382
that I don't really wanna eat this.

500
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,427
Grandfather…

501
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,305
[Yaad]

502
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,767
he always blamed himself
for being the one who made the mad mage

503
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,686
become obsessed with black magic.

504
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,523
So in order to look for help,
he headed to the surface.

505
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,944
Perhaps you know,
how did he fare up there?

506
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,737
Well, from what I've heard,

507
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,699
he was seen emerging
from the underground cemetery.

508
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,243
[Marcille]
of a ruined country,</i></c.bg_transparent>

509
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,913
and would give his entire kingdom
to the one who defeated the mad mage,

510
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,707
then turned to dust.

511
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,458
[Yaad] Is that so?

512
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,461
He's finally been released from his agony.

513
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,463
Knowing this brings me solace.

514
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,216
[Yaad] Many people have attempted
to escape the curse

515
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,592
by leaving the village.

516
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,886
However, none have succeeded.

517
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,431
And their physical bodies
are lost as a result.

518
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,310
[Yaad]
you gradually lose yourself,</i></c.bg_transparent>

519
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:55,480
become an evil ghost,
and then are unable to return here.

520
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,358
I'm sure you've encountered
these ghosts before.

521
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,359
[Laios party]

522
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,236
We attacked them with holy water

523
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,864
and then made a sorbet out of them!

524
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:08,493
So, anyway, you never told us
why we were called to this place.

525
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,786
The prophecy.

526
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,829
[Marcille] Prophecy?

527
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,747
Indeed.

528
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,334
[Yaad] "One shall arrive at the village
with winged sword in hand,

529
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,378
they will be the hero
who will defeat the mad mage

530
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,880
and set us all free."

531
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,089
[Chilchuck] Winged sword?

532
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,507
Does he mean Kensuke?

533
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,010
Well, there are wings on it, although…

534
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,138
Wait! This lion face
wasn't on here before!

535
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,347
[Laios] When did…

536
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,265
[happy gasp]

537
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,351
[Yaad]
is our guardian deity.</i></c.bg_transparent>

538
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,606
He was imprisoned at the very bottom
of the dungeon by the mad mage.

539
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,401
However, the Lion still guides us
by telling us prophecies

540
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,778
by way of our dreams.

541
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:47,282
And those prophecies are why
my grandfather left for the surface.

542
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,659
-[Yaad] Sir Laios.
-Hm?

543
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,912
There's more to the prophecy.

544
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:56,917
"With the winged sword in their hand,
the hero will defeat the mad mage,

545
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,170
and thus rise as the country's new king."

546
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,421
[stifled laugh]

547
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,131
[Marcille] Wait! You can't be serious!

548
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,592
[Chilchuck] He just picked up that sword
by complete accident!

549
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,260
It was no accident.

550
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:11,681
The fact the sword is in this room with us
means it was something preordained.

551
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,141
[both groan]

552
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,685
-Now, Sir Laios…
-Hm?

553
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,438
[Yaad] Can you please
promise me something?

554
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,816
Promise me you'll defeat the mad mage

555
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,026
-and free everyone in this village.
-[horrified gasping]

556
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,152
Huh?

557
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,320
But I…

558
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,072
-[groans]
-[Laios] Uh…

559
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,532
[breathes softly]

560
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,329
Can you please let me think about it?

561
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,706
You've gotta turn him down.

562
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,042
[Chilchuck] Why bother
giving them hope like that?

563
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,461
'Cause I can't flat-out refuse.

564
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,506
Kensuke, when did you even get like this?

565
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,590
Huh, buddy?

566
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,969
[Laios] Maybe it was when you got eaten
by the Dungeon Cleaners.

567
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,348
I was actually so nervous during all that.

568
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,226
I couldn't really taste any of the food
they made for us.

569
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,520
-[groans]
-You've got some nerve, you know that?

570
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,106
-Specifically requested by the party, huh?
-[pained grunt]

571
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,734
It really didn't have
that much flavor to begin with.

572
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,652
[both] Huh?

573
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,989
[Senshi] He said they have no appetite,
so they don't need to eat anything.

574
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,534
I think it's safe to assume that's why
they're not very good at cooking.

575
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,245
I just realized something.

576
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,289
[Senshi]

577
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:20,000
They don't really need to tend fields
and use dishware,

578
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,252
so why bother keeping them around?

579
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,462
What was the point
in wasting all that energy

580
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:28,258
to continue maintaining them
for the last thousand years or so?

581
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,887
[Senshi] I reckon it's 'cause
they actually do need those things.

582
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,389
It helps them keep their sanity

583
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,558
and gives them a reason to live.

584
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,809
[both sigh]

585
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,269
-[Senshi] Laios.
-Huh?

586
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,314
[Senshi] When we were with the orc chief
on the third floor,

587
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,733
I still remember exactly
what you told him.

588
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,650
[Laios] Huh?

589
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,653
What did I say again?

590
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,821
[Senshi] Well…
[groans]

591
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,073
…make sure you take the night
to think about it.

592
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,033
[Laios sighs]

593
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,328
Do you mind if I sleep in here too?

594
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,455
Go sleep in the room they gave you.

595
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,165
But I don't wanna be alone in there!

596
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,209
[Marcille] And Izutsumi is being weird.

597
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,460
Come on, scoot over.

598
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,170
[Chilchuck] Just sleep on the floor!

599
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,672
[Laios]

600
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,974
[closing theme music playing]
